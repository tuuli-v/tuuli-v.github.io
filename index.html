		<p><b>House Prices and Rents in a Dynamic Spatial Equilibrium</b> (draft coming soon) </p>
		<p>House prices and rents evolve differently across regions in many countries. To study the causes and the welfare consequences of rent and price changes across space, 
		I set up a quantitative  dynamic  spatial equilibrium model of housing demand and supply. In the model, changes in expected rents growth or in discounting can cause price-to-rent ratio changes. 
		I show how to invert the model in order to recover changes in underlying economic fundamentals that would rationalize the observed rents, prices, migration and construction. 
		I take the model to data in the case of Finland, where house prices have been diverging across regions, even if rents have not. 
		Through the lens of the model, the rapid price divergence between big and small cities can be rationalized as the combination of an increase in the  value of living in cities and diverging discount rates. 
		These changes have benefited renters across locations but created an important regional divergence of homeowner wealth across smaller and larger cities.  </p>

		<p>  This paper studies the effects of housing allowances on rents. 
		Our research design is based on a reform that made the allowance more generous for small housing units as a quasi-experimental setting. 
		We find that large increases in housing allowances for small housing units have little or no effect on their rents relative to larger units. 
		Thus, the incidence of the reform is largely on allowance recipients and not on their landlords. 
		 Consistent with very moderate rent effects, we do not find evidence of recipient households responding to the increased incentive to choose small units. 
		    A possible explanation is that optimization frictions and short expected allowance spell duration limited demand responses to the reform.    </p>
		   
		<p><b>Housing Search And Liquidity in the Cross-Section of Market Segments</b>  <br>
		coauthored with <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/thierry-magnac" target="_blank">Thierry Magnac</a> </p>

		    
		<p>Regional differences in house prices are often seen to be problematic, but the housing market is not only segmented along the price dimension: market segments also differ in sales times. 
			As prices and sales times are negatively correlated in the cross-section of market segments, failing to account for sales time dispersion can leave us to underestimate the regional differences in house values. 
			We bring together a model of frictional search in a market consisting of multiple segments with the idea of a spatial equilibrium in order to quantify the cross-segment welfare differences of home-sellers.
			We estimate the model using data on prices, sales times and market tightness from Finland and find important welfare costs of search frictions in illiquid market segments. 
			Our model also suggests that on a market which clears partially through prices and partially through sales times, shocks will have effects on both. 
			As an illustration, a uniform property tax increase would decrease the value of selling a home in every segment but by different magnitudes: 
			a 10% tax would decrease values by 10-21% depending on the segment, and price divergence would increase.  </p>
